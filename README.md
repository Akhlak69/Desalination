# Desalination
Files starting with desal full/desalfull are the main files. Once the main file is opened, the supporting files that need to be opened, can be seen. The supporting files depend on the main file.
For example desalfull_icons will require desal_with_controller file in the IES. desal_with_controller will need the desalination plant (desal_effects_block) and the controller (controller_2).
Depending on the number of stages, all the effects need to be opened for desal_effect_block. Similarly all other main files can be run.
